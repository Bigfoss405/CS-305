**What Problem Did They Have?** <br/>
The company was concerned about vulnerabilities in their software that could put customer data at risk. They wanted these issues identified and fixed to improve security.<br/>
<br/>
**What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities?** <br/>
**Identifying Problems:** The vulnerabilities were identified through careful testing, including automated scans, manual reviews, and testing the software in different scenarios.<br/>
**Fixing the Problems:** The security issues were fixed by implementing secure coding practices, validating user input, and improving authentication processes.<br/>
**Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?** <br/>
Secure coding helps prevent data breaches, ensures compliance with regulations, and protects the company’s reputation. It also builds customer trust, which is crucial for a financial services company<br/>

**Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?** <br/>
**Challenging:** Finding more complex vulnerabilities that weren’t obvious. Deciding which issues to address first based on risk. <br/>
**Helpful:** Using automated tools to get a clear starting point. <br/>

**How did you increase layers of security?** <br/> 
Added multi-factor authentication for users. Enforced stricter access controls and encrypted sensitive data. Set up logging and monitoring to track suspicious activities. <br/>
**In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?** <br/>
OWASP dependency-check. <br/>
<br/>
**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure?** <br/> 
Tested the code to make sure it still worked as intended after fixing security issues.<br/>
**After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?** <br/>
Ran additional security tests to ensure no new problems were introduced after changes.<br/>
<br/>
**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?** <br/>
**Tools:** Automated scanning tools and secure coding plugins.<br/>
**Practices:** Following secure coding standards, doing regular code reviews, and testing for security as part of the development process.<br/>
<br/>
**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?** <br/>
Reports showing vulnerabilities found and fixed. Before-and-after examples of improved code. Results from security testing that show the improvements made.
